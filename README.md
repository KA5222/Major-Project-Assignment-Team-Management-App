# Major-Project-Assignment-Team-Management-App

The Application works as a tool to manage sports players and teams in a sport of the user’s choosing. It will allow the user to create parameters based on the necessities presented by a certain sport (ex. Goals scored for soccer players or height for basketball players). It will also allow the players to be sorted based on a variety of factors. There will be a feature regarding players switching teams during the end of the season. It can also sort the teams and players by their score. It is useful for those who keep up with multiple sports and different leagues in each sport and want to track them for the season. The application has a menu which will have a table for the teams or players and will allow for user input. The input will be sent to a text file and then sorted and displayed on the table.

The new version replaces the insertion sort with a binary seach tree and a hash table in order to manage the team and score data. Data input options will be implemented soon.
